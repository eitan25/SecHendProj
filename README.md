In the used car market there is a problem of mistrust:
    The car owners try to sale their car at the best price:
        Without considering its history, (liesing/car accident/neglect).
    The buyers try to get lowest price for the "new" used car,
        Usualy he can try to choose car by the car manufacturer raputation,
        check if the specific car is a good fit by ride test and mechanical test.
    Bouth saler and buyer think that the other is gaining more profit,
    and that way many possible deals do not success.
    
In our project we want to understand wich car is "best saller".

We will do so by scraping and analyzing data from "yad2.co.il" site.
